# User Stories Directory

## Overview
This directory contains user stories for the ALX Airbnb Clone Project. User stories are a way of describing system functionality from an end-user perspective. They help to ensure that development efforts are focused on delivering value to users.

## Contents
- `user-stories.md`: Contains the user stories derived from the use case diagram created in Task 1

## Purpose
The user stories in this directory serve as a bridge between technical requirements and business value. They capture the essential interactions that users will have with the Airbnb clone system and provide context for why these interactions are important.

## Structure of User Stories
Each user story follows this format:
- "As a [user role], I want to [action/functionality] so that [benefit/value]"

This structure ensures that we not only capture what functionality is needed but also why it matters to the user.

## Usage
These user stories should be used as a reference during development to ensure that implemented features align with user needs and expectations. They can also serve as a basis for creating more detailed technical specifications and acceptance criteria.
